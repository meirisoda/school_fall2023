## (4) Why/How are emotions important and/or functional (intrapersonal, dyadic, in a group)?
Emotions serve very important communicative functions in several different sizes, within yourself, with one other person and in group and community settings. Usually the function of emotion in most of these settings is to help with anticipating behavior and understand why one does the behavior that they do. And this appears to be innate! I answered this very same question in my midterm and stated that the baby (in the midterm surprise stimulus) was not yet old enough to quantify and identify emotion, yet was able to feel the amount of emotion coming from the mother's singing. 
When listening to the Story Corps surprise stimulus, it was quite heartwarming to listen to the son finding himself following in his father's footsteps. He said that he never really wanted to, and that dj-ing was just something that his father did, but one day he just picked it up. The father was also probably not consciously pushing this onto his son or wanted him to (maybe he did? I wouldn't know), but just the very existence of the father's favorite pastime being around the son influenced him to follow in his footsteps. Again, an innate desire to follow suit and bounce off of what a young child sees. The influence of parents in their childrens' lives cannot be ignored. 
To answer the rest of the function of emotion in different groups beyond a dyad (two people), emotions can also be used to communicate dominance. It lets one person know that they have the superior ground to the other, or convey no dominance at all! It is entirely possible to use emotions to convey the fact that everybody is on the same page. 
Another way that emotions can be useful are in group settings. In the readings and in our class discussions, we established that in group settings, emotion can be used to clearly define a hierarchy. There are leaders and then there are followers, and emotions can be used to keep both in check. However, in the Story Corps surprise stimulus, the emotions served a very different function. During the pandemic, due to minimal interaction and communication between people, and thus less utilization of emotion, people were having a hard time. The father and son, wanting to help the community, started doing sets every week. And as every week went on, the amount of people showing up kept increasing. The positive emotions that the two were able to share was spread throughout the community and helped bring everybody together. This is an example of how positive emotions in a group can function as a high moti
## (7) How do people communicate emotions? Relatedly, how are emotions in others measured (behaviorally, autonomically, neutrally, via self report)?
