## Positive Reminiscence
### Functions
1. Helps establish and maintain personal identity, either by affirming oneself through a sense of temporal continuity or by making oneself and one's past seem unique. 
	아 이거 공감 
	뭔가 나의 삶이 특별했다는 것을 prove 하면 내가 좋아진(?) 뭔가 다른 사람들 보다 잘나간다는 느낌이 들어 큐ㅠ큐ㅠㅋㅋㅋ
2. Bolstering self-esteem, or by generating pleasure and enjoyment just for the sake of it.
3. Mechanism for coping with negative experience
	1. Reminiscence can be a sign of deteriorating interest in the external world or an ineffective attempt to cope with present stress by escaping into the past
	2. Other people argue t hat it is an adaptive coping response that provides comfort, reduces negative affect, and helps resolve problems and conflicts. 
4. A means to an end of obtaining closure on difficult events in one's life (development of the Gestalt reminiscence therapy).
### Reminiscence in Younger Adults 
Adjustment remains a relevant construct across the lifespan (hence why reminiscence is not necessarily limited to older adults).
#### Mutual/Social Reminiscence
Social reminiscing was an effective emotion regulation strategy in enhancing positive emotions --> Increased with age. 
Mutual reminiscing (negative events as well as positive ones) do not have any age-dependent results. 

Results suggest that older adults are more capable of extracting powerful positive feelings from mutual reminiscence than younger adults. 
## Assessment
Study whether or not reminiscence serves the same functions for younger adults and whether these functions are positively or negatively associated with the perceived ability to enjoy life. 

Assuming reminiscence is positive, seems likely that individuals who used reminiscence either to gain self
### Techniques and effects of a strategy
Clinical interventions aimed at teaching older adults to stimulate the process of reminiscence, either by reviewing photographs, scrapbooks and other memorabilia or by making pilgrimages back to important places from their past. 
Combining journal writing with reminiscence enhanced well-being in older adults (which also enhanced the experience of reminiscence itself).

People who use specific strategies to stimulate or intensify recall of the past may be better able to reminisce in a vivid, engaging way than people who lack specific strategies for intensifying recall.

> Enables people to obtain more affective benefits from reminiscence than simply reminiscing without using strategies

Stimulating reminisence primarily based on cognitive imagery will generally be more effective than externally based imagery in generating affective and physiological states.
	which is very interesting because externalized cognition is quite effective at serving its purpose, but I guess in comparison to internalization, externalization is not as effective as it has a dependency. 
## Study 1
### Hypotheses
- Positive reminiscence would primarily serve as an adaptive function for young adults by helping them gain self-insight, solve problems, and generate positive affect. 
	- Paralleling with older adults
- The more time young adults spend reminiscing about positive memories, the more capable they will feel of savoring their lives. 
	- Based off adaptive function
- People who use reminiscence to gain self-insight will feel more capable of savoring their lives, compared to people who reminisced primarily to escape from the present. 
	- Based off theoretical speculation (Butler, 1962; Bavighurts, 1959)
- Having a personal strategy for intensifying recall will be associated with a greater perceived capacity to savor positive outcomes, relative to having no strategy. 
	- Based off adaptive function
- Relying on mental imagery to intensify recall is associated with greater perceived savoring capacity than relying primarily on behavioral strategies to intensify recall. 
	- Based on work in guided imagery. 
- Women will report spending more time reminiscing about positive memories and having a greater capacity to savor positive experience; will be more likely to use reminiscence to gain constructive self-insight and are less likely to use reminiscence to escape from the present. 
### Results
Young people seem to reminisce most often about relationships with other people rather than objects, places or events. 
People reminisce about relatively recent events (<5 years) compared to longer ago. 
#### When
1. When alone
2. When feeling down
3. When both alone and feeling down
Most people typically reminiscence when experiencing negative affect 
--> supports the notion that positive reminiscence serves primarily as a coping strategy for reducing or eliminating subjective distress. 
#### Primary consequences
1. Gain new perspective and self-insight towards present problems
2. Positive affect
3. Escape from the present
### Discussion
While reminiscing about pleasant memories to escape present problems may be maladaptive because it makes one's current situation seem even worse in contrast to the more pleasant past; reminiscing to gain motivation, perspective, or self-insight may be more adaptive because it provides something constructive that one can bring back to the present to help solve ongoing problems. 
#### Cognitive vs Externalized Imagery
Cognitive imagery may allow one more freedom to acitvely embellish memory and to recall a wider range of details about the past event through free-association or active fantasy. 
External imagery tends to restrict one solely to details of the past that are represented by that particular external object or environmental situation, making one less likely to recall other details, such as thoughts and feelings. 
	This makes sense. 
#### Sex Differences
Women reported a greater capacity to savor positive outcomes than did men. 
## Study 2
### Hypotheses and Limitations of Study 1
Using results to draw inferences about cause and effect. 
- Reminiscing about positive memories using either cognitive imagery or memorabilia would increase the reported frequency of happiness relative to the control condition
- Reminiscing about positive memories using cognitive imagery would produce a greater increase in the reported frequency of happiness, compared to reminiscing about positive memories using memorabilia. 
### Results and Discussion
Both forms of reminiscence increased the frequency of happiness over the weeklong study, whereas the control treatment did not. 
People who used cognitive imagery reported a greater increase in happiness than externalized imagery. 
#### Vividness and Detail in Memories
Does vividenss of recall mediate the creater increase in frequency of happiness found in the cognitive imagery group relative to the memorabilia group? 

Vividness of recalled memories does affect the greater impact of cognitive imagery, but not the amount of recalled detail. 
# Dube et al. 
Help participants set, plan and pursue personal goals through a learning process based on literature on goal intervention. 
Focused on retirees who find themselves at a loss for their purpose in life. 
	웃기게도 나는 은퇴 하지도 않았는데 (시작 하지도 않은 나) 나도 내 인생의 의미, 길이 뭔지를 잃은 느낌이 든다 

Educational and preventative interventions that provide opportunities, not just to improve quality of life and actualize potential, but to also identify coping strategies to deal with typical problems at this stage of life. 
Focused on the developing of attitudes and abilites to find personal projects that add meaning to their life.

## Subjective Well-Being (SWB)
Multidimentional and looked with both positive and negative as well as cogniftive and affective variables. 

Markers chosen are:
- happiness (short-term)
- Psychological well-being indicators (personal growth, self-acceptance, positive relationships with others, environmental mastery, purpose in life, autonomy)
- distress
## Personal Goals and SWB
### Goal Setting
Personal goals are based off of self-conceptions and fundamental psychological needs (also cannot ignore the broader sociocultural context)
	사람따라 다르다; 그 시절에 필요한것
Internal and external imperatives have to be made into personalized plans appropriate for the stage of life they are in. 
Goal can affect:
- translating motivation into action
- energy focusing
- behavioural self-regulation
- personality functioning

The presence of personal goals is positively related to life satisfaction and purpose in life; extremely beneficial for one's mental health. 
>[!highlight]
>If desires are not transformed into **firm intentions**, they will never be achieved and will give rise to regret, negative affects or various types of pathology.

### Goal Planning
Planning: mental exercise that prepares for action; includes activities that help to achieve the selected goal: 
- exploring possibilities
- looking for ways to achieve it
- defining steps
- identifying circumstances related to initiating action
- identifying the required skills
- forseeing obstacles and planning strategies to deal with them
	- "Defensive pessimism" (imagining the worst) can increase effort needed to increase performance but can also cause emotional burden and cause exhaustion. 
- seeking help if necessary

Some things that are detrimental to SWB are resignation, hopelessness, feelings of incompetence in problem solving. 
	뭔가 내가 할 수 없다는 거랑, 나의 미래에는 희망이 없다; 난 지금 이 길에 너무 깊이 빠져있다는 감정들이 나 한테는 너무나 안좋은 것이다. 난 내가 할 수 있다는 것을 믿어야되고, 다만 믿지만 있지 말고, 해.내.야.한.다. 

Good planning is associated with a state of cognitive, emotional and behavioural readiness. 
### Goal Pursuit
Optimal experience (flow). 
Personal and environmental resources, social support and life events have a positive effect on SWB only if these variablese facilitate progress towards the goal. 

Progress towards goals will only enhance SWB if the goals are in harmony with fundamental psychological needs; ie. only beneficial if the goal-directed initiated is taken for intrinsic reasons. 
#### Strategies for regulation
- Tenacity, which is characterized by one's perserverence despite obstacles
- Flexibility, which is the ability to adjust to situational constraitns. 
	- Powerful predictor of SWB indicators
	- Helps to avoid serious problems with the goals are unattainable. 
- Self-regulation/managing one's health
- Prioritization
### Discussion
People who achieve their golas have positive self-assessment and high feelings of personal efficacy, which in turn affects their self-image and esteem --> feedback loop. 

Success may not always generate happiness; why?
- Achieving the goal drained too much energy
- Value of the goal declined
- Ambition to do better is still present
- Achievement left a void
#### Things Gained
Regardless of if the goal was obtained, the overall process is always evaluated. 
Have you: 
- Overcome certain obstacels?
- Learned something
- Refined some skills
- Actualized some of your potential
- And thus have faith in your future? 
## Study Discussion
Personal goal management program was effective in improving the participants' ability to realize their goals by learning how to set, plan, and pursue their retirement projects.
Also increased their orientation towards the future and developed hope and ability to identify various ways to achieve their goals. 

It is possible to teach individuals how to integrate and use the componenets/strategies involved in the different steps to achieve goal realization. 
# King et al.
There is a clear implication that meaning in life contributes to a happier life. 
"Theory would suggest that meaning has a broad and pervasive influence on well-being" (Zika and Chamberlain, 1992).
## Meaning of Life
Different definitions: 
- Defined as a sense of one's life having a purpose or investing time and energy into the attainment of cherished goals.
- When the individual has a sense that one's life is coherent. 
- Occuring through personal accomplishments, encounters with others, or encounters with art and nature. 
- Can be attained by attaching oneself or one's existence to a larger framwork of meaning such as religion or a philosophy of life. 
- Fulfilling four psychological needs:
	1. Purpose
	2. Value
	3. Efficacy 
	4. Self-worth
Dependent on interpersonal relationships, self-improvement and understanding and behaving in ways that are congruent with one's beliefs. 
>[!highlight]
>Lives may be experienced as meaning ful when they are felt to have significance beyond the trivial or momentary, to have purpose, or to have a coherence that transcends chaos. 

### Cognitive Effects of PA
PA may facilitate the discovery or construction of meaning. 
People experiencing positive emotions are also more open to processing new types of information and have greater cognitive flexibility. 
PA typically encourages a global rather than a local focus, suggesting that positive emotions help to broaden the scope of attention. 
### Mood as Information and Input
Mood may provide some insight to one's experience and interpretation of their meaning of life. Positive mood indicates that one is making satisfactory progress towards one's goals. 
#### Search for Meaning
However, the relationship between PA and meaning has largely been ignored because meaning of life is usually searched for when circumstances lead individuals to question the meaningfulness of existence and thus, search for meaning. 
After negative life events, finding meaning can help return to positive levels of functioning. 
>[!highlight]
>Routine discovery of the meaning of life through negative life experiences can create strong associations in memory. 
>PA may become linked conceptually with the idea that life is meaningful. 

People use their current mood as a source of information when making evaluative judgements. (Example: the effect of weather on mood and thus overall life satisfaction)
People are prone to use their mood as a **primary** source of information when making judgemnets about global life domains. 
#### Cognitive Effort
People in positive moods exert less cognitive effort when making judgements and are subsequently more likely to use a simple "feelings-as-information" heuristic when compared to people in negative moods. 
	보통 상태가 안좋으면 자기의 감정에 따라서 결정을 내리면 안좋을 수 있으니까 보통 생각을 더 해야된다고 하는데
	내가 생각할때는 상태가 안좋은때 사람의 결정 능력이 많이 떨어지는 것 같은데
	But I agree with the cognitive effort and load. 

Thus most measures of "meaning in life" rely on **intuitive** notions of what meaning means. 

Higher level measures of psychogical health (such as subjective well-being) have already been extensively studied, however, lower level not as much. 
## Daily Experience
Meaning in life is not simply a global judgement made about a life as a whole, but potentially a quality of everyday existence. 
## Study Discussion
### Study 1
Mood, positive emotional traits and global appraisal dimensions have significant relationships with meaning in life. 
General PA predicted higher levels of meaning in life, and general NA predicted lower levels. 

Meaning in life is more strongly related to mood than to goal appraisals. 
### Study 2 
10 observations in daily mood, goal activity and meaning in life (also have to take into account dependencies).

Daily meaning in life is related to **current mood** and the retrospective global estimates of meaning is related to **average daily PA**. 
Which begs the question if there is a prospective relationship between mood and meaning in life. 
### Study 3
There is no prospective relationship between the experience of meaning in life and PA. There may be a strong correlation, but there is not sufficient evidence. 
### Study 4
Positive mood concept priming did not influence mood. 
## General Discussion
Strong evidence for strong relationship between mood and th
