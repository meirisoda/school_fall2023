One stimulus - 2 topics 
Surprise stimulus - 2 topics

I think I want to write about either "The Tire Iron and the Tamale" or "A Failure of Happiness"
## (1) **What is an emotion?** The parameters used to study emotion, and the component approach. 

## (2) **What causes emotions?** Major theories about how they unfurl.
Functionalist perspective -- emotions are functional and constitute solutions to environmental changes.
- **Evolutionary Theories**
	- Based on the notion that emotions are biologically based and serve an <mark class="hltr-grey">evolutionary function</mark> to provide advantages for survival
	- Not interested in using emotional expression to support this theory
	- Darwin argued for a <mark class="hltr-grey">communicative or signaling function</mark> of facial expression
	- Cosmides & Tooby wrote that the brain uses different mental programs and emotions activate or deactivate some. 
- **Cognitive Appraisal Theories**
	- Physiological representations of emotional significance
	- Schacter & Singer (1962) —> cognition could differentiate emotion (individuals sometimes experience emotion with no known cause).
	- Emotion arises from <mark class="hltr-yellow">processes of evaluation of significant events</mark> -- **appraisal of event determines which discrete emotion is experienced** (depends on the individual)
	- Emotions do not unfold in a hard-wired way -- because it is not a program!! 
- **Social Constructionist Theories**
	- Differs between cultures and social norms
	- an individual cannot experience any given emotion until he has<mark class="hltr-yellow"> learned to interpret situations in terms of the standards and moral imperatives endorsed by the culture that are relevant to that emotion.</mark>
## (3) **How are emotions understood?** Discrete versus dimensional accounts. Three major theories about the relationship between PA and NA. 
- **Theories**
	- **Fredrickson**:<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> Broaden and Build</mark> -- for self
		- Positive emotions lead to a <mark class="hltr-grey">building of physical and psychological resources</mark>
		- Builds muscular and vascular fitness
		- Allows for practice of skills such as danger negotiation and social confrontation
		- Fosters exploration
		- Help build relationships with others -- involve norms and reciprocity
		- PA help <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"undo" negative emotions</mark>
	- **Shiota**: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Social Constructionist Model</mark> -- for relationships -- **construct social relationships!!!** 
		- Positive emotions are important for romantic relationships; due to desire leading to flirting behavior, display of affection, love and compassion helps maintain relationships
		- Needs to be generally mostly positive
		- <mark class="hltr-yellow">Reciprocation</mark>
- **Positive Affectivity
	- relatively poorly differentiated
	- lack of interest and research
- **Negative Affectivity**
## (4) **Why/how are emotions important or functional** (intrapersonal, dyadic, in a group)? 
- Emotions are used to communicate; helps anticipate behavior and understand why -- appears to be innate
- **Intrapersonal**
	- emotions motivate adaptive action and facilitate adjustment to environmental demands
	- Emotions coordinate the brain's different functional "programs"
- **Dyad**
	- communicates love/attraction: postural/facial/vocal expression changes which bring reciprocal hormonal and behavioral effect
	- communicates dominance
	- elicit <mark class="hltr-yellow">complementary emotions</mark> (reciprocal/responsive)
- **Group**
	- vital to social coordination and helps create bonds to define boundaries
	- helps define hierarchy of the group

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
## (5) **Levenson's 1999 Core-Control System**
Emotion regulation is a <mark class="hltr-grey">lifelong process</mark> of working out an etiquette of action and interaction between the two emotion systems... let the core system sufficiently free reign so that it can serve its<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> basic adaptive functions</mark>, while maintaining sufficient controls so as to minimize the potential negative effects that unrestrained emotions can have on the individual and on others.
- 2 system model
	1. Input goes into the core system
	2. **Core** -- older, primitive and usually fail-safe
		- autonomic
	3. **Control** -- responds to situation and core system, based on the core system's reaction
		- highly flexible and sensitive to learning 
		- **fine-tuning the operation throughout the lifespan** -- what emotions we express now
		1. Alters the **input** by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">altering the conditions</mark> (how we appraise a situation)
			- reduces emotional behavior and felt emotion with little physiological cost
		2. Alters the **output** by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">intercepting tendencies to response to prototypic situations in characteristic ways; modulates the translation of response tendencies to resulting behavior</mark>
			- reduces emotional behavior but doesn't change felt emotion -- physiological cost
## (6) **Emotion elicitation**. Pros, cons, and unique nature of each method (movies, slides, music, social psychological, etc.) - both in research and in the real world. 
- **Movies** 
	- film images are an illusion of reality and represent a dynamic display of prototypic situations relevant to well-being and survival --> high in ecological validity. 
	- films are naturalistic and more generalizable 
	- **(1) proximity of activation and measurement periods** 
		- emotions take time to show up -- delay may cause altered responses
		- likely to be distorted by errors or systematic biases in recall (Levenson 1988)
		- to avoid this, they use continuous measures of emotion experience
		- **the act of repeated measurement can potentially alter the emotional response itself**
	- **(2) extraction of emotions**
		- films have low temporal resolution and typically create heterogeneous epoch of data
- **Slides**
	- International Affective Picture System (IAPS) -- over 1,000 pictures 
	- quite reliable, easy to control physical parameters such as image size, brightness, color, duration, complexity
- Music
- **Social Psychological**
	- cover story to mask deception and designed to create realistic, emotion-inducing situations, often highly emotional 
	- involves manipulation -- quite difficult 
	- Extremely realistic, avoids demand characteristics, potent, targets discrete emotions that are difficult to elicit

## (7) **How do people communicate emotions?** Relatedly, how are emotions in other measured (behaviorally, autonomically, neurally, via self-report)?
- Communication
	- Verbally (words, tone, volume)
	- Facial Expression
	- Bodily Cues
	- **Affect Research**
		- real life inductions
		- reading affective statements
		- directed facial expressions
		- imagery
- Major and most widely used measures
	- Mood Adjective Checklist (MACL)
	- Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist (MAACL)
	- Profile of Mood States (POMS)
	- **Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X)**
		- Orthogonally related 
		- Two scales of (not positive -- positive; not negative -- negative)
		- Excellent internal consistency and discriminant validity
	- Differential Emotions Scale (DES)
	- **Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM)**
		- ![[Pasted image 20231015185019.png]]
## (8) What strategies do people use to regulate/control their emotions? Which strategies are most effective, and why? 
- **Response Systems**
	- **Experiential** -- emotional valence or discrete emotions
	- **Behavioral** -- facial expression, postural changes, behavioral movements
	- **Physiological**
		- Sympathetic nervous system
		- Parasympathetic nervous system
- Different kinds of strategies include:
	- **Antecedent** (stimulus-focused) strategies -- similar to control system
		- **Reappraisal** -- <mark class="hltr-yellow">alters the trajectory</mark> of all three response systems (above)
		- Situation selection
		- Situation modification
		- Attentional deployment
		- Cognitive change
	- **Response-focused** strategies
		**- Suppression** -- reduces behavioral expression; produces no change in emotional experience; no change in autonomic arousal
			typically associated with greater sympathetic arousal (Gross & Levenson 1997) --> suppression decreases amusement but not sadness
		- Exaggeration
- Results
	- **High Suppression** results in<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> lower PA, less NA expression but same or more NA</mark>
		- high cognitive cost
		- continuous - 전부 다 경험하고 느끼는데 당현이 그렇치 
		- lower memory 
	- **High Reappraisal** results in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">lower NA, higher PA </mark>
		- less cognitively costly
		- initiated early and diffuses the emotional experience
- Controlled vs Automatic
	- **Controlled** -- requires attentional resources, driven by explicit goals (Mauss & Gross)
	- **Automatic** -- initiated by simple registration of sensory inputs, knowledge structures (schema, scripts), shape functions 
		- can become maladaptive and unable to recognize negative emotions 

## (9) How do emotions influence the way in which people process information and/or form decisions?
Affect as information -- positive emotions are an indicator of the value of stimulus. 
Important for a person's own cognitions and inclinations. 
### Global vs Local Focus
Highly anxious people adopt a more "local" focus. 
Happy moods caue people to rely on brand names relative to product attributes (ie. associating the quality of the product based off of brand experience)
### Fear vs Anger
**Fear** arises from and elicits appraisals of uncertainty and situational con프라임킹즈trol
**Anger** tends to elicit feelings of certainty and individual control
### Approaches in Motivation
Low approach motivation tends to be small things, like funny films or recalling pleasant memories
High Approach motivation is associated with enthusiasm or desire 
--> PA does not broaden, and rather narrows. 
### Brain Systems & Rationality
People should behave in ways to optimize their utility - but they often don't. 
#### Emotional
- Tends to be automatic
- Evolutionarily old
- Highly conserved 
- Well adapted for specific purposes프라임킹즈
#### Cognitive
- Controlled and conscious
- Extremely limited (can only procecss 1 or 2 things at a time)
- More adaptive; supports a broad range of goals

These two systems tend to compete, resulting in irrational behaviour. 
## (10) Jonathon Cohen: How does the brain reflect a person's cognitive-emotion decision-making?
People make decisions that maximize their utility - which is an assumption that people always act rationally in accordance with their long-term goals. 
It is more realistic to assume that people seek to optimize utility subject to their constraints, which can be: limited access to information, limited ability to learn and the limited ability to focus and control behavior. 
In the past our emotions, which can be categorized as a system of their own, helped us to survive. It helped us assess our situations and act quickly and correctly. However, we no longer live in a society where our lives are always at stake, and the decisions that we have to make are much more complex. 
Two systems are usually at work with a person's cognitive-emotional decision marking: the emotions (core) system and the higher-level (control) system. The emotional system is highly reactive, and give us quick and automatic responses. They are good for situations that require that level of quick-"thinking" but not so good at more general tasks that require behavior that is consistent across time and can support a broader range of goals. 
Neuroscience research shows that there is a correlation between brain activity and behavioral responses/decision making. The brain can be divided into multiple sections, each corresponding to a different point in human evolution - and they all serve different purposes. Subcortical structures, particularly those nearer the brainstem, have existed early in human evolution and are responsible for a lot of emotional processing. They release neurotransmitters (like dopamine) and are responsible for the reward and happiness system. The subcortical structures make direct connections with the more newly evolved frontal lobes and form something called the limbic system. The limbic system is critical in emotional processing, which places an important role in decision making. 
This is displayed in the Failure of Happiness vignette. We see a young man with a seemingly bright future, highly motivated and highly disciplined. However, we follow the story and watch him fall victim 

However, our brain still requires further brain structures to aid in decision making and behavior control. These brain structures (referring to the prefrontal cortex) are usually associated with higher-level processes: reasoning abilities and the capacity for cognitive control. Cognitive control can be defined as the ability to change behavior and appraisal in association with the person's goals or intentions, even when emotions prevent "correct" action. 
The activation of brain regions regarding emotional and more "practical" responses were studied by giving participants in a research study certain choices they had to make. The classic trolley problem (where a person has to decide between letting a train kill 5 workers tied to a track, or divert those 5 deaths by switching the trolley to a different track, which will instead kill one person) was presented alongside an alternative dilemma known as the footbridge scenario. This situation replaces the more distanced decision by instead directly pushing a person off a bridge to stop the trolley from running over the 5 workers. This places the two dilemmas in two different categories: a "personal" moral dilemma, the footbridge dilemma which inflicts direct and serious bodily harm on a different individal, and "impersonal" moral dilemmas like the switch dilemma, which involves the harm in a more removed fashion. 

## (11) Working memory capacity and emotion regulation: How does WMC influence one's ability to control their emotions?
### Subsystems
#### Phonological Loop
- Temporarily holds verbal and acoustic information; is limited
#### Visuospatial Sketchpad
- Temporarily holds visual and spatial information; also is limited.
#### Episodic Buffer
- Forms and interface betwen the above, long-term memory and the central executive
### Central Executive
Assumed to allow for flexible, controlled processing of information in the service of one's goals. 
#### Functions
1. To allocate attention to a task
2. To enable the flexible, content-relevant manipulation of Working Memory
3. To inhibit prepotent responses that may interfere with the present task or goal.
### Self-Regulation & Working Memory
Anything that involves the control of internal states and/or external behavior; overriding prepotent responses. 
By keeping an active representation of goals and goal-relevant information in your working memory, self-regulation is increased. 
- it can flexbily update the working memory and keep it focused on context-relevant information pertinent to the desired goal
- It inhibits unwanted thoughts and emotional reactions that run counter to said goal
- It inhibits and overrides unwanted behavioural responses.
#### Maintain focus on the goal
### Top-Down vs Bottom-Up Processing 
#### Bottom-Up Processes
Emotions, desires, urges involve automatic and prepotent responses
Strong signals 
#### Top-Down Processing
Look at the goal and keep you on the right track. 
### Monitoring of the Self
Monitor the:
- Current context/situation
- One's inner states
- One's actions
Discrepancies between the current states and goal states may be identified and resolved.

One can modify behavior or alter goals once identified. (Intelligent self-regulation involves flexibly adjusting plans when confronted with obstacles)
### Thought Suppression
Is not sustainable long-term because it places attentional spotlight on the thing that you want to ignore and requires an immense amount of mental energy and saps resources. 

By suppressing your thoughts, you are adding a secondary task, which will compromise the executive functioning of yourself. 
### Attention Control
Attnetion is typically bottom-up; we attend to salient, motivationally relevant stimuli
We also have some top-down control of attention, based on goal representations in the working memeory. 
## (12) Increasing Happiness - Perspective Taking and Goals. How might someone increase their long-term happiness using these strategies? 
[[12 Reading Notes]]
Mention the broaden and build theory!!! 
### Ideas for response
~ A Failure of Happiness

### Self-Determination Theory
Concept of need satisfaction dependent on the degree to which these three differnet qualities of experience accompanied free-listed, time-consuming daily activities. 
Competence, autonomy and relatedness over time leades to an increase in longitudinal well-being. 
Again, all three of these things are linked to eachother and provide positive feedback loops for each thing. 
## (13) Increasing Happiness - Forgiveness and Gratitude. How might someone increase their long-term happiness using these strategies? 


### What causes happiness?
Material goods, spiritual and psychological origins and also flow states. 
#### Flow states
Happiness stems from activities which demand the individual's full involvement and attention. 
- Experiences that are worth doing for their own sake
- Requires skill, concentration and perserverence
- Those with autotelic personalities report more frequent experiences of happiness. 
How to achieve flow:
- Create conditions that allow for full angagement in activities
- Seek out flow in places that demand physical, mental, or emotional energy
### Material Rewards
Why aren't they enough? 
- Escalation of expectations
- Relative Deprivation
	- Individuals compare their position to those who have the most
	- Sociocultural
- Need a variety in sources of happiness
- Time Scarcity 
### Relative Happiness
Individuals tend to enhance the relative value of their own outcome with someone else's less fortunate outcome.
