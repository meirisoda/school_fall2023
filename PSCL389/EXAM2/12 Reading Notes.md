## Positive Reminiscence
### Functions
1. Helps establish and maintain personal identity, either by affirming oneself through a sense of temporal continuity or by making oneself and one's past seem unique. 
	아 이거 공감 
	뭔가 나의 삶이 특별했다는 것을 prove 하면 내가 좋아진(?) 뭔가 다른 사람들 보다 잘나간다는 느낌이 들어 큐ㅠ큐ㅠㅋㅋㅋ
2. Bolstering self-esteem, or by generating pleasure and enjoyment just for the sake of it.
3. Mechanism for coping with negative experience
	1. Reminiscence can be a sign of deteriorating interest in the external world or an ineffective attempt to cope with present stress by escaping into the past
	2. Other people argue t hat it is an adaptive coping response that provides comfort, reduces negative affect, and helps resolve problems and conflicts. 
4. A means to an end of obtaining closure on difficult events in one's life (development of the Gestalt reminiscence therapy).
### Reminiscence in Younger Adults 
Adjustment remains a relevant construct across the lifespan (hence why reminiscence is not necessarily limited to older adults).
#### Mutual/Social Reminiscence
Social reminiscing was an effective emotion regulation strategy in enhancing positive emotions --> Increased with age. 
Mutual reminiscing (negative events as well as positive ones) do not have any age-dependent results. 

Results suggest that older adults are more capable of extracting powerful positive feelings from mutual reminiscence than younger adults. 
## Assessment
Study whether or not reminiscence serves the same functions for younger adults and whether these functions are positively or negatively associated with the perceived ability to enjoy life. 

Assuming reminiscence is positive, seems likely that individuals who used reminiscence either to gain self
### Techniques and effects of a strategy
Clinical interventions aimed at teaching older adults to stimulate the process of reminiscence, either by reviewing photographs, scrapbooks and other memorabilia or by making pilgrimages back to important places from their past. 
Combining journal writing with reminiscence enhanced well-being in older adults (which also enhanced the experience of reminiscence itself).

People who use specific strategies to stimulate or intensify recall of the past may be better able to reminisce in a vivid, engaging way than people who lack specific strategies for intensifying recall.

> Enables people to obtain more affective benefits from reminiscence than simply reminiscing without using strategies

Stimulating reminisence primarily based on cognitive imagery will generally be more effective than externally based imagery in generating affective and physiological states.
	which is very interesting because externalized cognition is quite effective at serving its purpose, but I guess in comparison to internalization, externalization is not as effective as it has a dependency. 
## Study 1
### Hypotheses
- Positive reminiscence would primarily serve as an adaptive function for young adults by helping them gain self-insight, solve problems, and generate positive affect. 
	- Paralleling with older adults
- The more time young adults spend reminiscing about positive memories, the more capable they will feel of savoring their lives. 
	- Based off adaptive function
- People who use reminiscence to gain self-insight will feel more capable of savoring their lives, compared to people who reminisced primarily to escape from the present. 
	- Based off theoretical speculation (Butler, 1962; Bavighurts, 1959)
- Having a personal strategy for intensifying recall will be associated with a greater perceived capacity to savor positive outcomes, relative to having no strategy. 
	- Based off adaptive function
- Relying on mental imagery to intensify recall is associated with greater perceived savoring capacity than relying primarily on behavioral strategies to intensify recall. 
	- Based on work in guided imagery. 
- Women will report spending more time reminiscing about positive memories and having a greater capacity to savor positive experience; will be more likely to use reminiscence to gain constructive self-insight and are less likely to use reminiscence to escape from the pr
