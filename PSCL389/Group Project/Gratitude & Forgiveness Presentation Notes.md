# Studies
So the first study that was conducted was to interview these different groups that were mentioned beofre:  the lottery winners, accident victims (which were the paraplegics/quadriplegits) and a control group (these people lived within a certain radius of the lottery winners)

**Lottery winners** were informed that the research was a study of lotteries. 
**Control group** was told that the research was a study of everyday life. Did not mention the lottery winners to avoid instituting an unfavorable comparison for the controls.
## So some questions that were asked
were dependent on the group

There were obvious General background questions (age, occupation, race, religion, level of education).
But there were a differnece in questions asked between lottery winners and accident victims. They were asked several open-ended questions such as:
"Has your lifestyle changed in any way wince you won? How?"
"Do you feel you in any way deserved what happened?"
"Do you ask yourself, 'Why me?' How do you answer to that question?"

And for all three groups, in order to measure general happiness, these questions were asked: 
- How happy are you in your current stage of life?
- How happy were you before winning (lottery)
- How happy were you before the accident (victims)
- How happy were you 6 months ago (control)
- How happy do you expect to be in a couple years?
- How pleasant do you find these activities:
	- Talking with a friend
	- Watching television
	- Eating breakfast
	- Hearing a funny joke
	- Getting a compliment
	- Reading a magazine
	- Buying clothes (only for the lottery winners and control group)

# Findings and Discussion
Although ottery winners generally reported their lives after lives after winning the lottery to be generally more positive, and accident victims reported their lives to be generally less positive.
As mentioned before, lottery winners took less pleasure than controls in a variety of ordinary events and were not in general happier than the controls. 

Both lottery winners and accident victims found their happiness surrounding mundane events to be less positive compared to the control group.
	On a scale of 0-5 (0 the worst thing and 5 the best thing):
	Lottery 3.78 and victims 1.28
	 it is roughly symmetric around the mean (2.5).
So accident victims weren't as unhappy as we would normally expect. 

Why is this? and how can this be explained with adaptation level theory? 
## Adaptation Level Theory Justification
At first, winning the lottery would make other events seem less pleasurable, by **contrast.** Over time, this event may not seem to have any effect at all due to **habituation.**

There is an interesting caveat with accdient victims. Although accident victims did not tend to take more pleasure in ordinary events and rated themselves as less happy than the contorls, there was a significant difference in how they rated their PAST happiness compared to their PRESENT. 
## This is called the Nostalgia Effect
and this also relates back to adaptation level theory. 
By **contrast** to their state currently, their lives seem happier before the accident. However, due to **habituation** their present level of happiness is not as bad as one would expect. 

# Why is there a difference?
In order to study the reasoning behind why there is a differnce in happiness, a second study was conducted. 
## Second Study
The two major explanations as to why there were differences
1. The difference is not an effect of the lottery but a general tendency for people who buy lottery tickets to find less pleasure in their daily lives than people who don't buy tickets. People who are satisfied and happy with their lives don't tend to feel the need to buy a lottery ticket to induce some sort of positive change, and people who buy tickets want that happiness trigger. ==So there is a difference in baseline==
2. Merely introducing the study as a study of lottery winners may have shifted the focus of happiness to be relative to the lottery winnings.The lottery winners are aware of their special status currently and so reference point of happiness was changed to focus on their winnigns. 

So how this study was conducted was that lottery winners and the control group were asked more questions regarding their satisfaction of their work and personal lives, and for lottery winners, purchasing habits. 
## So the Results of this study show that 
Buyers and nonbuyers of lottery tickets are quite similar in their **present** happiness but there is a significant difference in reported **past** and predicted **future** happiness. 

For the Lottery winners: future > past
	Because in **contrast** to their big winner's life, their past seems unhappy in comparison. 
Control: past > future
	Because they don't have any major contrast point to base their future happiness off of. 

So again, this is aligned with adaptation level theory. 
## So what are the limitations of this study? 
Limitation is that the data is obtained from this study is from only at a single point in time and do not trace out the the temporal course of adaptation. 
A longitudinal study might be good to determine how adaptation level effects change over time for lottery winners. So following the levels of happiness before purchasing the lottery ticket, during the lottery winning and years afterwards. 
# Some Alternative Explanations outside of the adaptation level theory is that 
Good luck in a lottery can actually be more painful and stress-inducing than pleasurable.

Sudden changes or extreme outcomes, even though positive, may be stress inducing . By winning the lottery, you suddenly gain a large sum of money. You have pressure to conform to people's expectations of your level of happiness, you may also have to start taking preventatory measures in the case that people start developing maliicous feelings towards you (jealousy)

Stories such as Faustus, King Midas or the Sorcerer's Apprentice that warn us that having our dreams fulfilled may actually create more problems than are solved.
### Another alternative explanation is that the lottery winners may have reported less pleasure in their every day events in order to appear modest and minimize the importance of their success. 
While this may be trure this is not a valid explanation. 
Because if they really wanted to downplay the effects of winning, Negative features of the win should have been mentioned. But nothing negative was mentioned and only the positive effects of winning the lottery were mentioned. 
## Another explanation is that 
winning the lottery changed the perspective that people have on everyday events without changing the actual pleasure they received from these events. 
This is called 
### Perspective Theory 
However this did not appear to be 
# Implications these two studies is that 
happiness *is* relative! 

We, as observers, tend to overestimate the happiness and despair of others

I want to end with a quote from the reading

“Though overlooking compensatory contrast effects, we overestimate the overall magnitude and generality of the positive or negative feeling generated by an event. Through overlooking habituation effects, we overestimate the general duration of feeling generated by an event”
