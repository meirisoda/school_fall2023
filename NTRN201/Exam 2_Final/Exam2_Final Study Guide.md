# Midterm Content
## American Diet
American diet has increased sodium, carbohydrate, fat and protein intake while not meeting the dietary fiber needs nor some other essential micronutrients. 
### MyPlate
Basic message is: **Start Simple with MyPlate** 
To encourage a balanced diet and provide easy visualization. 
## Macronutrients
### Glucose
Storage form is glycogen -- stored in the muscles and liver. 
1. **glucose** - found in table sugar; essential for the bloodstream
2. **fructose** - found in fruits, honey; converted to glucose in the liver
3. **galactose**
#### Dietary Fiber
1. **Soluble** - found in soft parts ~~ slows digestion, reduces cholesterol and CHD, helps produce bile
2. **Insoluble** - cellulose ~~ bulks up stool 
**Functional Fibers** are added fibers that can usually serve as a prebiotic.
### Protein
Protein regulates and maintains bodily functions and provides a source of energy for the muscles in the instance that glucose stores run out. 
**Provides the essential form of nitrogen.** 

**Complementary Proteins** are incomplete proteins that can be ingested alongside another to make up for lost amino acids. 
### Lipids

## Vitamins
Carbon-containing substance sneeded in small amounts by the body. In order to classify as a vitamin, the body can't make enough to maintain its health and in the case of deficiencies, whatever function was lost can be cured if the vitamin is resupplied.
