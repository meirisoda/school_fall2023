# Bone Health
**Hydroxyapatite** - crystalline compount containing calcium, phosphorus and sometimes fluoride
## Vitamin D 
15mcg-> 100mg 
Calcitriol is the biologically active form
$\downarrow$ bone problems, decreased calcium absorption, rickets
$\uparrow$ fetal malformations, hair loss and skin changes, bone pain 
### Functions 
- maintenance of calcium and phosphorus
- regulates calcium excretion via kidney (along with PTH) --> **calcitonin** decreases calcium levels
- immune system function
- cell cycle regulation
### Sources
- salmon, fortified cereal, fortified milk and egg yolk
## Calcium
1000mg->2500mg
### Functions
- bone growth and stuff
- muscule contraction
- cellular metabolism
## Phosphorus
700mg->3-4g/day
### Functions
- component of hydroxyapatite 
- part of DNA and RNA 
- primary component of ATP
- allows enzymes and B vitamins to function 
### Sources
milk, cheese, meat, nuts, fish
## Magnesium
400mg/d
### Functions
- nerve and heart function
- relaxes muscle after contraction
- provides rigitiy to bones
### Sources
chlorophyll/plant sources, milk and meats
# Energy Metabolism
apoenzyme -- inactive form of enzyme
cofactor -- substance that combines with an inactive form of enzyme to activate it
coenzyme -- organic cofactors
## Thiamine (B1)
### Functions
metabolism of carbohydrates and branched chain amino acids
$\downarrow$ Beriberi and wernicke korsakoff syndrome
## Riboflavin
involved in energy metabolism, B-vitamin metabolism, antioxidant
$\downarrow$ ariboflavinosis
## Niacin (B3)
Coenzymes (NAD+ and NADP+)
catabolism of energy-yielding nutrients
can be synthesized from tryptophan
$\downarrow$ pellagra 
## Biotin (B7)
coenzyme of glucose production and fat synthesis
hair and nails
excreted via bile and urine
## Folate (B9)
400/600mcg/day -> 1000mcg (may mask B12 deficiency)
involved in cell division, metabolism of amino acids and DNA formation
green leafy vegetables
$\downarrow$ megaloblastic anemia 
## B12
coenzyme of folate metabolism and maintains myelin sheath
requires IF for absorption
$\downarrow$ nerve function 
# Immunity
## Carotenoids 
reduce macular degeneration
prevent CVD
prevent cancer in the lungs, mouth, skin and prostate 
## Vitamin A
900/700mcg -> 3000mcg
### Functions
- promote vision and growth
- skin and eyes
- promotes resistance to bacterial infection
### Sources
fish and fish oils, liver, fortified milk and cereals
can be synthesized from $\beta$-carotene

$\downarrow$ night blindness and poor growth
$\uparrow$ fetal malformations, hair loss and bone fraactures
## Vitamin E
-> 1000mg/day
### Functions
found in adipose tissue and cell membrane (because PUFA polyunsaturated fatty acids)
important in areas exposed to high levels of oxygen
prevents breakdown of vitamin A and PUFA
### Sources 
vegetable oils, nuts and seeds 

$\uparrow$ interferes with vitamin K and anticoagulant medications 
## Vitamin C 
75/90mg.day
### Functions
collagen synthesis
serotonin and norepinephrine synthesis
## Zinc
-> 100mg
