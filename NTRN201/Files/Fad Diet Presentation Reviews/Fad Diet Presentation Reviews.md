# Cabbage Soup Diet
### What's involved with following this diet? 
You are allowed to eat 1â€“2 other low-calorie foods daily in addition to the soup. However, it is important not to make any other substitutions and to drink only water or other calorie-free beverages, such as unsweetened tea.
Increasing and changing the food consumed with every passing day. 
### Who is it for? 
For people who want to lose weight. 
### Is it backed by scientific research? 
No, because regardless of anecdotal evidence, the cabbage soup diet does not have any scientific evidence backing  up its claims.  
Nor does cabbage or cabbage soup offer any extravagant fat-burning properties it's purported to have.
### Is it dangerous? 
May cause some neurological and cognitive symptoms due to lack of energy stores able to be used by the brain. 
### Would you recommend? 
I would not recommend this diet because it is not sustainable long-term. Although it may provide some health benefits, it is not enough to separate the low carb diet as special compared to some other dietary modifications. However, the low carb diet does do better compared to the Atkins diet.
