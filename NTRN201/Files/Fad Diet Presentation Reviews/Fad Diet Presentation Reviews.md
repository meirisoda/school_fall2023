# One Food/Mono Diet
### What's involved with following this diet? 
Diet includes eating only one food item or group for all meals of the day. 

### Is it backed by scientific research? 
Not really. It may help lower blood sugar levels due to restricting the amount of carbs consumed. 
### Is it dangerous? 
Yes, it can be dangerous because of nutritional imbalance, the high amount of sodium and fat and is not very diverse. 
### Would you recommend? 
I would not recommend this diet because the supposed benefits: lowering blood sugar levels, weight loss, increased mental clarity, physical well-being and improvements in some chronic medical conditions; isn't enough to outweigh the cons. The desired result from following this diet can be achieved through healtheir means.
