# Paleo Diet
### What's involved with following this diet? 
Diet involves limiting sugar, increasing vegetable intake, and limiting processed foods. You are not allowed to eat grains, dairy, processed food, refined sugar and added salt. 
### Who is it for? 
For people who want to lose weight  in a quick and convenient way. 
### Is it backed by scientific research? 
Not at all. 
### Is it dangerous? 
Yes, it can be dangerous because of it is very restrictive and may promote an unhealthy relationship with food and trigger developments of unhealthy habits. It can also cause a loss of muscle mass and have potential for nutrient toxities (due to restrictions to only one food.)
### Would you recommend? 
I would not recommend this diet because it is not sustainable, and also has negative effects on relationship with food and bodily health. The weight loss achieved with this diet is typically very short-term.
