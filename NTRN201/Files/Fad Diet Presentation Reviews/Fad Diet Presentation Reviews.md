# Intermittent Fasting
### What's involved with following this diet? 
Diet involves eating only during certain windows of time during the day. 
### Who is it for? 
For people who want to take control of their eating habits and also lose weight. 
### Is it backed by scientific research? 
There is some evidence saying that intermittent fasting can boost thinking and memory, improve blood pressure and heart health, increase physical performance and increase tissue health. May also reduce inflammatory responses. 
### Is it dangerous? 
Can be dangerous to those who have high sensitivity to restrictions and eating is highly dependent on present state (ie. people with diabetes). It can develop into unhealthy eating habits and relationship with food. May also cause fatigue, insomnia and other physiopsychological symptoms. 
### Would you recommend? 
I think this diet should be highly researched and evaluated by each person. It really depends on each individual person and their habits, personality, and physical health. But generally, I would not recommend it to any random person.
