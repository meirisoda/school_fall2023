# Carnivore Diet
### What's involved with following this diet? 
Diet is essentially the eating of meats or animal products every meal while excluding plant-based food. Can be expanded to include poultry, animal fats and seafood. 
### Who is it for? 
For people who want to lose weightan
### Is it backed by scientific research? 
No, because regardless of anecdotal evidence, the cabbage soup diet does not have any scientific evidence backing  up its claims.  
Nor does cabbage or cabbage soup offer any extravagant fat-burning properties it's purported to have.
### Is it dangerous? 
Yes, it can be dangerous due to the severely restrictive nature of the diet. 
### Would you recommend? 
I would not recommend this diet because it is not sustainable long-term. I personally do not see any health benefits to discuss. It seems very dangerous and restrictive.
