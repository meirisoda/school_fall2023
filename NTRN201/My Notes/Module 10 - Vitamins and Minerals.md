# Vitamins 
Carbon containing substances needed in small amounts by the body. (Essential: cannot be synthesized by the body.)
-  Body cannot make enough to maintain health.
-  Absence will lead to deficiency that can be cured with replenishment. 
## Fat-Soluble Vitamins
Absorbed and stored with dietary fat (so anything interfering with fat absorption will impair vitamin absorption).
Not readily excreted from the body. 
### Vitamin A
RDA: 900 micrograms (남) 700 micrograms (녀)

**Functions** 
- promote vision, night and color
- promotes growth
- prevents drying of the skin and eyes
- promotes resistance to bacterial infection and overall immune system function.

**Sources**
- Liver
- Fortified milk and breakfast cereals
- Dark leafy greens, sweet potatoes, carrots, cantaloupe, apricots 
- can also be synthesized from plant pigments!! (beta-carotene to vitamin A)

| Deficiency | Toxicity |
| --- | --- |
| Night blindness | Fetal malformations|
| Poor growth | Hair loss and skin changes |
| Dry skin | Bone pain and fractures |
| | **(upper limit is 3000 micrograms)** |
| | <mark class="hltr-yellow">toxicity is frequently observed </mark>  due to supplements| 
### Vitamin D
**Functions** 
- Maintenance of calcium and phosphorus 
- Immune system function
- Cell cycle regulation

**Sources**
- can also be synthesized from skin in sunlight.
### Vitamin E
**Functions** 

**Sources**
- can also be synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan.
### Vitamin K
**Functions** 

**Sources**
- can also be synthesized by the gut bacteria to some extent. 
## Water-Soluble Vitamins
Absorbed primarily in the small intestine. 
Transported to the liver via portal vein & distributed to body tissues, in which later they are stored. 
Particularly susceptible to destruction by heat, light, air exposure, cooking in water and alkalinity. 
Excreted via urine. 
### Vitamin C
### Vitamin B Complex
#### Thiamine (B1)
Involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates and branched-chain amino acids. 
Absorbed from the small intenstine, transported in coenzyme form by RBCs and excreted via urine. 
##### Deficiencies -- Beriberi
**Dry beriberi**: affects peripheral nervous and muscular systems
	peripheral neuropathy, weakness, muscle pain, anorexia, and confusion
**Wet beriberi**: affects the cardiovascular system
	enlargement of the heart, difficulty breathing and edema
##### Deficiencies -- Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome
Related to alcohol abuse, which decreases thiamin absorption and increases excretion (may also decrease intake due to the primary source of calories and nutrients being from alcohol)
Affects the central nervous system
	**Wernicke's**: acute confusion, changes in vision, ataxia
	**Korsakoff's**: amnesia, psychosis
#### Riboflavin
Involved in energy metabolism, B-vitamin metabolism (converts niacin from tryptophan, activates the b6 coenzyme and folate metablilsm), also is an antioxidant. 
HCl in the stomach releases bound riboflavin --> absorbed by active transport or facilitated diffusion from the small intestine (60-65% efficiency) --> transported through the blood by protein carriers --> converted to coenzyme form mainly in the small intestine, liver, heart and kidneys
##### Defiency -- Ariboflavinosis
Rare and requires 2 months of constnat deficient intake
	Inflamed throat, stomatitis, glossitis, angular cheilitis, seborrheic dermatitis, anemia, fatigue, confusion, headaches
#### Niacin (B3)
Comes in two forms:
- nicotinic acid (niacin)
- nicotinamid (niacinamide)
Functions in coenzymes (NAD+ and NADP+), catabolism of energy-yielding nutrients and fatty acid biosynthesis
Can be taken in directly from foods or indirectly (synthesized from tryptophan)

Absorbed inthe small intestine and transported to liver, excreted via urine
##### Defiency -- Pellagra
Rough skin
Associated with corn-based diets 
#### Pantothenic acid
#### Biotin
Coenzyme of glucose production and fat sysnthesis
Absorbed in the small intestine, and excreted via bile and urine
#### Vitamin B6
Stored in the liver. 
#### Folate (B9)
Involved in cell division, metabolism of amino acids and DNA formation
##### Deficiency -- Megaloblastic Anemia (Macrocytic anemia)
Immature cells can't divide because they can't form new DNA and keep growing larger
	Tongue inflammation, diarrhea, poor growth, mental confusion, depression, nerve dysfunction 
Recommended is 400 mcg/day (600mcg/day for pregnancy)
- Low folate levels in pregnant women are linked to neural tube defects in fetuses (important because neural tubes close within the first 28 days of pregnancy)
#### Vitamin B12 
Coenzyme of folate metabolism and aids in nerve function. ==maintains myeliln sheath that insulates neurons==
Requires Intrinsic Factor for absorption!!! 
Stored in the liver. 
##### Defiency
Will cause destruction of parts of the myelin sheath
	Irregular muscle actions, impaired reflexes and eventual paralysis
Pernicious anemia (anemia from lack of b12 absorption)
### Choline
# Minerals 
Individual chemical elements; cannot be broken down further.
Essential when you have dietary inadequacies causing physiological or structural abnormalities. 
**Major:** need >100mg per day
**Minor:** need <100mg per day
**Ultratrace:** trace amounts in diet, not essential to human health
#### Absorption
Majority absorbed in small intestine. 
Interacts with fiber: phytic acid and oxalic may decrease some mineral absorption
<mark class="hltr-yellow">Vitamin C increases iron absorption.
Vitamin D increases calcium absorption.</mark>
#### Storage
in the muscle tissue, organs and glands. 
# Blood Health
